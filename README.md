# Covid-Waste-Water-Exploration
Work with The DSI on exploring Covid prediction models. Looks at connecting the prevalence of COVID-19 Genes in waste water to the amount of COVID-19 in the community.

TSS-Analysis: Compares TSS data from dorms and MMSD 

curvework: Looks at the rate of change of % of covid tests returned Positive and creates a model to predict that

general-model-finding: Uses Waste water data to create a model for % of covid tests returned Positive

R^2HeatMap: Creates a heatmap of the R^2 of diffrent models and time changes
